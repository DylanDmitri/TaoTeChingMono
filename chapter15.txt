The ancient scholars of goodness,
Subtle and versed in all mystery,
They are beyond our discernments.
And being beyond discernment,
We must sketch an appearance:

Appearing hesitant as though fording an icy river.
Appearing still as though afraid of neighbors.
Appearing respectful as an invited guest.
Appearing dissapating as though the ice is melting.
Appearing kindhearted as one acting in simplcity.
Appearing vast as a valley.
Appearing cloudy as though muddled.

He prepares as if fording a river in winter; as if like in fear of neighbors;
Solemn that seems to allow; vanishing like ice that melts away;
Honest that is like simple; broad that is like a valley;
Blending that is like muddy water


    Hesitant as one fording an icy river, as if in fear of neighbors.
    Solemn and formal as guests, vanishing as the ice that shall melt.

    Hesitant as one crossing an icy river, as if in fear of neighbors.
    Solemn and formal as guests, vanishing as the ice that shall melt.

    Honest as simple wood,
    Vast as a wide valley,
    Opaque as muddy water.

保此道者不欲盈    guard these tao ones not desire overfill
夫唯不盈          man alone not overfill
故能蔽不新成      so ableto cover not new become

Those who follow this Tao will not be conceited.
Only through lack of conceit can one be renewed
    when worn out and dying.

He who holds fast to this way, desires not to be full.
It is because he is not full
That he can be worn and yet newly made.

One who holds this Tao does not wish to be overfilled
Because one is not overfilled
Therefore one can preserve and not create anew


One who keeps the TAO does not desire to overfill.
And by not overflowing, 
Is able to persist while being made anew.
