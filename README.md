Special care taken to
preserve line lengths and parellel structure, & 
ensure paired and repeated words are reflected.

First caveat: This is me cross referencing several translations and dicionaries, I don't speak Chinese.

Second caveat: I borrow phrases from western religious culture to make some relationships more apparent.

I am not trying to replicate the original. 
I am trying to make another thing that is also good.
The forced poetry is a reminder to take metaphorically.
