治大國若烹小鮮  govern great country simile cook small fish
以道蒞天下     by tao administer heaven-down
其鬼不神      its demons not gods    (in potency)
非其鬼不神     notonly its demons not gods
其神不傷人     its gods not injure you
非其神不傷人    notonly its gods not injure you
聖人亦不傷人    holy person also not injure you
夫兩不相傷     man two not eachother injure
故德交歸焉     so virtue turnover return here       "return to it"


Govern a great nation; cook a small fish,

    With TAO administer the world,
    Its demons then without power,

Not only its demons without power,
But its powers shall not harm you,

Not only will powers not harm you,
But holy people will not harm you,

These two do not harm one another,
Thus virtue again returns to them.
