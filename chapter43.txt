天下之至柔        heaven-down of very soft
馳騁天下之至堅     rush-headlong heaven-down of very firm

The very soft of this world,
Overwhelm the very firm of this world.


無有             without having
入於無間          enter at without-space 

What is without substance,
Can enter places that are without space.


吾是以知無為之有益  I so by knows without action of having benefit

By this I know the benefit of taking no action.


  Acts by taking no actions,
  Teaches by using no words.

Teaching by using no words,

Teaches by using no words.
Gains by taking no action.

These are beyond most of the world.


處無為之事               (at)(without)(for)(of)(abstract thing)    

不言之教          not words of teaching
無為之益          without action of benefit
天下希及之        heaven-down hope reach of
