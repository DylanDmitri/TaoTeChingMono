將欲取天下而為之     shall desire take heaven-down and act of
吾見其不得已         I see it not to obtain alrady

Those who wish to take the world and control it
I see that they cannot succeed

Do you think you can conquer the universe and improve it?
I do not believe this can be done.

Whoever takes the empire and wishes to do anything to it I see will have no respite.
The empire is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it.

To win the world with [human] effort—
I see that it can only fail.

With desire choosing anything, of doing I see no satisfied end.
All under heaven is divine capacity, nothing can be done to it either.

With desire choosing anything, of doing I see no satisfied end.
All under heaven is divine talent; nothing must be done either.


Who shall seize the world and improve it?
I see that this cannot be done.

天下神器             heaven-down gods utensils
不可為也             not can act also
為者敗之             act beings defeat of
執者失之             executeplan beings fail of


The world is a divine instrument,
And thus it cannot be controlled.
Those who control it face defeat,
Those who grasp for it will fail.


故物                 therefore things
或行或隨             maybe line maybe follow
或歔或吹             maybe snort maybe blow  -> alt translation
或強或羸             maybe powerful maybe lean
或挫或隳             maybe opresses maybe overthrown

Therefore a physical thing,
    Sometimes leads  sometimes follows
    Sometimes warms  sometimes relaxes
    Sometimes makes  sometimes weakens
    Sometimes rules  sometimes overthrows

是以聖人             yes by holy person
去甚                 removes extremes
去奢                 removes extravagance
去泰                 removes arrogance

So a holy person,
    abandons ,
    abandons extravagance,
    abandons arrogance

    Those who grasp for it will fail.

Therefore a physical thing:
    Sometimes leads  sometimes follows,
    Sometimes warms  sometimes relaxes,
    Sometimes makes  sometimes weakens,
    Sometimes rules  sometimes revolts.

So a holy person:
    avoids grasping control,
    avoids owning in excess,
    avoids having arrogance.
