How, then, should a ruler of ten thousand chariots
Make light of his own person in the eyes of the empire?

How can the lords of ten thousand chariots
Apply themselves lightly to the world?

However, some rulers of great nations are self centered,
Making light of the world to their own ruin.

Make themself lighter before the world?

How should the master of many chariots,
Make light of themselves before the world?
