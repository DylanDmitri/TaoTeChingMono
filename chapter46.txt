天下有道       heaven-down has tao
卻走馬以糞     while riding-horse usedfor manure 
天下無道       heaven-down without tao
戎馬生於郊     army-horse beget at outskirts
罪莫大於可欲    guilt nothing-great-at able desire
禍莫大於不知足  disaster nothing-great-at not know-contentment
咎莫大於欲得    fault nothing-great-at desire need
故知足之足     so know-contentment of contentment
常足矣        eternal contentment finality!


The world has TAO  swift horses valued for manure.
The world lacks TAO  warhorses born on the border.

    No crime     greater than acting on desire,
    No calamity  greater than being discontent.
    No fault     greater than nuturing avarice.

Therefore, be content with contentment,
Contentment is eternal!


    Thus, contentment of knowing contentment
    and be content forever.

    Thus, know content with contement,
    and be content forever.




No crime    greater than acting on desire,
No calamity greater than not knowing contentment.
No fault    greater than nuturing avarice.

No disaster greater than not knowing contentment.
