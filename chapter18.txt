大道廢           big tao abandoned
有仁義           have benevolence justice

智慧出           wisdom intelligence arisetogether
有大偽           have big bogus

六親不和         close-family not togther
有孝慈           have filialpiety compassion

國家昏亂         country-home twilight-confusion
有忠臣           have faithful-official


Great Tao abandoned, have benevolence and justice.
Intelligence pours forth, have great frauds.
Family is in conflict, have piety and compassion.
Country is in confusion, have faithful officials

The great Tao fades away, there is benevolence and justice
Intelligence comes forth, there is great deception
The six relations are not harmonious, there is filial piety and kind affection
The country is in confused chaos, there are loyal ministers

When the great way falls into disuse, There are benevolence and rectitude;
When cleverness emerges, There is great hypocrisy;
When the six relations are at variance, There are filial children;
When the state is benighted, There are loyal ministers.

When the great Tao is rejected, humanity and justice arise.
When wisdom comes, great falsity arises.
When family members cannot live in harmony, filial piety and compassion arise.
When the nation is in chaos, loyal officials arise.


Tao is abandoned    truth and justice.
Intelligence grows    fakes and fraud.
Family argues    piety and compassion.
Chaotic country    faithful officials.
