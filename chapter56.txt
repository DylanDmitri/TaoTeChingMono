知者不言       know those not words
言者不知       words those not know

Those who know have no words,
Those with words do not know,

Those who know do not speak,
Those who speak do not know.


塞其兑        stopper keeps pouring
閉其門         closed keeps gate

    Keeps words held,
    Keeps gates shut,
    Keeps edges dull,
    Keeps ropes free,
    Keeps light warm,
    Keeps earth rich.

Its name: Mystic Unity.

挫其銳          dull keeps edges
解其紛          unfought keeps riots
和其光          together keeps light
同其塵          same keeps dirt
是謂玄同        yes called mystery same

故不可得而親   thus can-not obtain and near    -/ relatives and family
不可得而疏     can-not obtain and distant      /
不可得而利     can-not obtain and sharp
不可得而害     can-not obtain and troubles
不可得而貴     can-not obtain and expensive
不可得而賤     can-not obtain and lowly
故為天下貴     thus action heaven-down expensive

Therefore,
    It cannot be made as close family,
    Nor can it be kept at a distance.

    It cannot be worked for a benefit,
    Nor can it result in any troubles.

    It cannot be valued as expensive,
    Nor can it be valued as worthless.

Thus the world of unity is priceless.
