Holding a cup and overfilling it
Cannot be as good as stopping short
Pounding a blade and sharpening it
Cannot be kept for long
Gold and jade fill up the room
No one is able to protect them
Wealth and position bring arrogance
And leave disasters upon oneself

It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, 
than to attempt to carry it when it is full. 
If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened,
the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.
When gold and jade fill the hall, 
their possessor cannot keep them safe. 
When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, 
this brings its evil on itself

Better to stop pouring 
Than to keep on overflowing.
Forge a blade with a thousand blows;
Its sharpness still will not last long.
Gold and jade may fill your house,
But how long can they be kept?
Pride in wealth and rank 
will bring you only curses.


Obtained success
Retreat yourself



Better to stop pouring
than overflow your cup.

Overly sharpened edges
will not last for long.

Rooms of gold and jade
that no one can defend.

Opulence and arrogance
bring self destruction.

Obtained success?
Withdraw yourself.
This is the WAY of heaven.



Stopping a pour
to not overflow.

Over sharpening
dulls the blade.

A treasure room
no one is there.

Money and pride
create calamity

bring on curses
bring on ruin
collapse itself
destroy themselves
brings calamity
