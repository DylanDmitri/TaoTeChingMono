不尚賢
使民不爭
不貴難得之貨
使民不為盜
不見可欲
使民心不亂

是以聖人之治
虛其心
實其腹
弱其志
強其骨

常使民無知無欲
使夫智者不敢為也
為無為
則無不治

是以聖人之治    (yes by holy person) of (govern)
虛其心         (empties/timids) (its) (heart)  \ verbs contrast
實其腹         (makes real) (its) (belly)      /
弱其志         (weakens) (its) (ambition)   \ verbs contrast
強其骨         (strengthens) (its) (bones)  /

ambition == blood (literally)
stable physical foundation == bones (literally)

So the governance of a holy person:
  keeps hearts clear
  keeps bellies full
  keeps blood cooled
  keeps bones strong

Thus the governance of the sage:
  Empties their hearts
  Fills their bellies
  Weakens their ambitions
  Strengthens their bones

Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, 
  empties their minds, 
  fills their bellies, 
  weakens their wills, 
  strengthens their bones. 

Therefore, the Holy One rules by:
  humbling people’s hearts,
  filling their stomachs,
  subduing their will,
  strengthening their bones.


note -- we ca remove the "keep" here

So the governance of a holy person:
  clears hearts 
  fills bellies
  calms blood
  strengthens bones

  it keeps bellies full
  it keeps blood cooled
  it keeps bones strong

Let the people have no cunning and no greed
So those who scheme will not dare to meddle

Makes the people without cunning and without desire,
