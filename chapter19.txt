此三者 以為文不足  these 3 things  by without culture not sufficient
故令有所屬       thus make having place-belonging
見素抱樸         see unadorned embrace simple
少私寡欲         young personal scant desire


These three, being uncultured, are not enough.
Thus this teaching finds the place it belongs:

    Observe the plain  embrace the simple.
    Reduce selfishness  make scant desire.
