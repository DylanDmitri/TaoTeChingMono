故善人者 不善人之師 therefore good man person   not good man of teacher
不善人者 善人之資   not good man person         good man of support
不貴其師            not expensive its teacher
不愛其資            not love its student
雖智大迷            eventhough wise great bewilder
是謂要妙            so function demand clever


Thus the good man is a model for the weak man,
And the weak provides support for the good man.
And the weak man will support the good man.

Thus the good man will teach the weak man,
And the weak man will support the good man,

Thus the good man is a model for the weak man,
And the weak man should support their teacher.

    Do not value the model,
    Nor love their student.

    This perplexing wisdom,
    Is an essential wonder.
