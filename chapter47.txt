不出戶 知天下  not arise house  know heaven-down
不闚牖 見天道  not peer window  see heaven-tao

Without leaving the house  know the whole world.
Without peering out windows  see a heavenly WAY.

Without peering out windows  see heaven and TAO.
Without peering out windows  see the TAO of heaven.
Without peering out windows  see the heavenly TAO.
Without peering out windows  see heavenly TAO.

Without peering out windows  see road to heaven.
Without peering from windows  see road to heaven.



其出彌遠      its arise tofill tao
其知彌少      its know tofill youth

Travels fut
Travelling further,
Then knowing less,

Then less knowledge is less


    Move further,
    Less knowing.

So a holy person,
    Does not walk yet knows,
    Does not find yet names,
    Without acting provides.



是以聖人      so-the-holy-person
不行而知      not walk and know
不見而名      not seek and name
不為而成      not act and produce
