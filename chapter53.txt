If I have a little knowledge
Walking on the great Tao
I fear only to deviate from it
The great Tao is broad and plain
But people like the side paths

Were I possessed of the least knowledge, 
I would, when walking on the great way, 
fear only paths that lead astray.
The great way is easy, 
yet people prefer by-paths.

Fearing only to deviate from it 
My only fear to leaving the path.
Fearing only to deviate from it.


Had I been introduced to a little knowledge,
I would walk along the great WAY,
My only fear is leaving the path.

The great WAY is smooth and even,
Yet the people prefer side paths.
