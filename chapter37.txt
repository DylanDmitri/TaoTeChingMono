道常無為           tao eternal without action
而無不為           but without not action
侯王若能守之        princes and kings ableto defend of
萬物將自化         10k things shall self changeinto
化而欲作           changeinto and desire towrite
吾將鎮之以無名之樸   I shall supress of by without name of simple
無名之樸           without name of simple
夫亦將無欲          great also shall without desire
不欲以靜           not desire by quiet
天下將自定          heaven down shall self define


Tao is constantly without action,
Also constantly without inaction.

If princes and kings could keep it,
Then all physical things transform.

Transformed yet desiring success.
I shall supress them with nameless simplicity.

    The nameless simplicity,
    Shall be without desire.

    Without desire, quietly,
    the world comes to rest.


quietly without desire
