Hold the great image,
The world will come.

Coming without harm, most harmonious,
With music and food, travellers stop,

The tao arising from the mouth,
Bland almost as without flavor.


視之不足見      lookat of not sufficient see
聽之不足聞      listenat of not sufficient hear
用之不足既      usage of not sufficient already

Looked for but not perceived, we call empty.
Listened for but not heard, we call hopeful.

Looking is not enough to perceive it.
Hearing is not enough to decipher it.
Being used is not enough to empty it.
