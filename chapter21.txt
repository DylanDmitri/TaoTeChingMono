To appear of virture,
Follow only the TAO.
TAO is not physical,

Only hazy, only indistinct,
So indistinct, and so hazy,

And among it is manifested,
So hazy, and so indistinct,

And among it dimly present,
So deep, so quiet, so dark,

And among it is an essence,
An essence greatly genuine,

And among it sits fidelity,
From ancient times til now,
Its name has never left it.

To observe the source of all,

We may observe its source.
By what means do I know the source of all things?
By these:




One that appears of virtue,
Will be following only TAO,
As a physical thing TAO is:

Only hazy, only indistinct,
So indistinct, and so hazy,

And among it is manifested,
So hazy, and so indistinct,

And among it dimly present,
So deep, so quiet, so dark,

And among it is an essence,
An essence greatly genuine,

And among it sits fidelity,
From ancient times til now,
Its name has never left it.

We may observe its parents,
By what means do I know the parents of this multitude?
By these:









So quiet deep so dark deep,
So deep in quiet and dark
Such deep quiet  darkness
