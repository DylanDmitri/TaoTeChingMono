有物混成            having name things produce
先天地生            first heaven-earth produce
寂兮寥兮            silent so empty so
獨立不改            alone stand not change

There is something formlessly created
Born before Heaven and Earth
So silent! So ethereal!
Independent and changeless

There is a thing confusedly formed, Born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void, It stands alone and does not change,

The outside world passes for the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
Still and silent, it alone does not change,

The outside world passes for the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
Still and silent, it alone does not change,

There is a thing fashioned,
Fashioned first, before Heaven & Earth
So silent! So empty!
Standing alone unchanging.


Created and bearing a name,
Created as Heaven and Earth,
So silent! So empty!
Alone and unchanging.


周行而不殆          circle walk and not perilous
可以為天下母        can be-without heaven-down mother         be-without = thinking maybe false

Walking the circle, 
Circular motion,

Created and bearing a name,
Created as Heaven and Earth,
So silent! So empty!
Alone and unchanging.

Walking the circle; free from peril,
I believe she is the mother of everything under Heaven.

Great means flowing past,
Flowing creates distance,
Distance leads to return,

So I say the word "Tao"
I can try describing it as "great"
Great means passing,
Passing means distant,
Distance is reversal,

To identify it, I call it "Tao"
Forced to describe it, I call it great
Great means passing
Passing means receding
Receding means returning
