天下皆知美之為美 斯惡已
   皆知善之為善 斯不善已

故有無相生
難易相成
長短相形
高下相傾
音聲相和
前後相隨

是以聖人
處無為之事
行不言之教
萬物作焉而不辭
生而不有
為而不恃
功成而弗居

夫唯弗居
是以不去

The world everyone knows beauty for being beautiful, such ugliness 

          everyone knows goodness as good, there is already evil

Heaven down, all know beautiful as beauty - such ugliness already.

PURPOSE: establish that opposite define each other

All the world knows beauty as beautiful, such ugliness already.
Everyone knows goodness as good, such evil already.

If everyone knows beauty as beautiful - already such ugliness.
If everyone knows goodness to be good - already such evil.

---------

Everyone in the world knows that taking beauty as beuaty is ugly.
We all know that doing good for good in evil.

Everyone knows that beauty is beautiful, but this is evil
We all know that good is good, but this is not good.

When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises
When it knows good as good, evil arises

All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; 
they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. 

If everyone knows beauty as beautiful, there is already ugliness;
If everyone knows kindness as kind, there is already evil.
