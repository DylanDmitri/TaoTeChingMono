以正治國      by correct govern country
以奇用兵      by odd touse soldiers
以無事取天下   by without plans seize heaven-down
吾何以知其然哉  "by what do I know" its nature ?!?
以此         by these

A properly governed country,
Uses soldiers with surprise,
Without a plan; seize the world.
By what do I know of its nature?
By these:


Rarely sees solders at work,
Finds odd the use of soldiers odd

天下多忌諱    heaven-down many jealous-conceal   (taboos)
而民彌貧     and people completely poor

民多利器     people many sharp-tools      (weapons)
國家滋昏     country-family nourish-twilight  (in chaos)


A world with many taboos,
Then its people are poor.

People with many weapons,
Country falls into chaos.

Men of talent and timing,
Odd events bring revolts.

Laws gain sophistication,
Then there is much theft.

So the holy person spoke:



人多伎巧     person many skill oportunely
奇物滋起     odd things nourish uprisings

法令滋彰     emulates command nourish distinguished
盜賊多有     thief-stealing many hass
故聖人云     thus holy-person spake:


我無為而民自化   I without-action and people self changeinto
我好靜而民自正   I proper quiet and people self correct

I act 
I keep from action; the people transform themselves.
I keep properly quiet; the people correct themselves.
I am without plans; the people enrich themselves.
I stay without desire; the people lead simple lives.


我無事而民自富   I without plans and people self wealthy
我無欲而民自樸   I without desire and people self simple


I act without action; the people change themselves.
I am properly quiet; the people correct themselves.
I am without schemes; the people enrich themselves.
I act without desire; the people lead simple lives.
