Five colors blind the eye.
Five tones deafen the ear.
Five tastes spoil the mouth.

Galloping and hunting makes 
the heart wild with excitement.

Difficult-to-find treasure
make people perform damage

So a holy person
  Fills the belly, 
  not the eyes
    
Thus one is chosen, 
the other discarded.



Five colors blind the eyes,
Five tones deafen the ears,
Five foods spoil the mouth,
Riding and hunting make the heart wild with excitement.
Difficult-to-find treasures make people turn on others.

So a holy person:
  fills their belly, 
  and not their eye.

Therefore one is chosen,
and the other discarded.
