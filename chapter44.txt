Fame or self, which is dearer?
Which destroys more, gaining or losing?
Which is more destructive gain or loss?
Which will destroy more, gain or loss?
Which can ruin more, gaining or losing?



Which is loved, your name or your self?
Which is more, your self or your coins?
Which is most ruinous, to gain or lose?

Thus, excess love certainly means great expense,
Continued hoarding certainly means heavy losses.

Know contentment, avoid disgrace.
Know when to stop, avoid dangers.

By these, endure to endless ages.
