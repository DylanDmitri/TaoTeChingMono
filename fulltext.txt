special care taken to:
    preserve line lengths and parellel structure
    ensure paired and repeated words are reflected

caveats:
    this is me cross referencing several translations and dicionaries, I don't speak chinese
    there's vocab and stock phrases that sneak in from my orthodox christian upbringing

I am not trying to replicate the original. 
I am trying to make another thing that is also good.
The forced poetry is a reminder to take metaphorically.

============================================
------------------- Ch 1 ------------------- 

A tao-able tao is not the constant TAO.
A name-able name, not the constant NAME.

Without name is the beginning of heaven and earth.
Bearing name is the mother of all physical things.

Therefore,
  Constantly without desire  gaze upon its source.
  Constantly bearing desire  gaze upon its effects.

Both these persons, of one essence yet differing in name,
Mystery of being one,
Mystery of mysteries, door to the source of great wonder.

------------------- Ch 2 ------------------- 

If everyone knows beauty as beautiful  already so ugly.
If everyone knows goodness to be good  already so evil.

Therefore:
  presence and absence produce one another
  difficult and easy complement one another
  long and short are shaped with one another
  high and low fall in love with one another
  voice and echo harmonize with one another
  before and after each follow one another

So a holy person:
  Acts by taking no actions.
  Teaches by using no words.
  Has all things but does not control them.
  Produces but does not possess.
  Provides but does not presume.
  Becomes successful without growing proud.

They do not grow proud, and 
success does not leave them.

------------------- Ch 3 ------------------- 

Stop proclaiming the great among you, and thus end fighting.
Stop treasuring stuff for its rarity, and thus end thievery.
Stop evoking desire, and thus bring serenity to every heart.

So the governance of a holy person:
  keeps hearts clear
  keeps bellies full
  keeps blood cooled
  keeps bones strong
  makes the people without scheming & without desire
  makes it so those with schemes dare not enact them

Act without acting,
and nothing will be ungoverned.

------------------- Ch 4 ------------------- 

The WAY is empty and usage will not fill it.
Its deepness prefigures all physical things:

  Keeping edges dull,
  Keeping ropes free,
  Keeping light warm,
  Keeping earth rich.

The PEARL sits, difficult to discern.
I do not know whose child it could be,
since it predates every visible god.

------------------- Ch 5 ------------------- 

Heaven & Earth are impartial, all physical things are chaff.
The holy person is impartial, the base multitudes are chaff.

The space between Heaven and Earth is like pair of bellows:
  Emptied, but never finished.
  Moved, but sending out more.

Countless words,
miss the center.

------------------- Ch 6 ------------------- 

Harvest spirits are immortal,
This is the feminine mystery.

The gate of feminine mystery,
The root of heaven and earth.

Flowing difficult to discern,
Persisting without oversight.

------------------- Ch 7 ------------------- 

The vast Heavens and eternal Earth,
Heaven and Earth will age and grow.

  By keeping selfless,
  they endure forever.

So a holy person,
puts themself last and is first,
denies themself and still lives.

So by keeping the self from evil,
the self is kept able to triumph.

------------------- Ch 8 ------------------- 

The highest goodness is like water;
Water nourishes all things without contention
It rests in places disliked by people;
Therefore it becomes as Tao:

    dwelling where proper
    kindness in its heart
    offering benevolently
    reliable in its words
    governing with wisdom
    acting in its ability
    having perfect timing

It lives without contention,
and becomes beyond reproach.

------------------- Ch 9 ------------------- 

Pours and stops  to not overflow.
Over sharpening  dulls the blade.
A treasure room  no one is there.
Money and pride  brings calamity.

  Task accomplished,
  withdraw yourself.

This is the WAY of heaven.

------------------- Ch 10 ------------------ 

Balancing a soul, holding TRUTH,
can you keep them both together?

Concentrating on soft breathing,
can you become as a little baby?

Polishing your surveying mirror,
can you make it without blemish?

Governing and loving all people,
can you resist from interfering?

Everday people are born and die,
can you keep the female mystery?

Gaining insight in all subjects,
can you avoid closing your mind?

It gives and sustains life:
  Produces but does not possess,
  Acts but does not seek thanks,
  Nutures but does not dominate.

It is called mystic virtue.

------------------- Ch 11 ------------------ 

Thirty spokes joining at one hub; the
 space between makes the wheel usable.

Knead clay to make the container; the
 emptiness makes the container usable.

Chisel a window to make the room; the
 interior space makes the room usable.

Hence when considering something,
consider how nothingness is used.

------------------- Ch 12 ------------------ 

Five colors blind the eyes,
Five tones deafen the ears,
Five foods spoil the mouth,
Riding and hunting make the heart wild with excitement.
Difficult-to-find treasures make people turn on others.

So a holy person:
  fills their belly,
  and not their eye.

Therefore one is chosen,
and the other discarded. 

------------------- Ch 13 ------------------ 

Favor and disgrace bring fear,
Having self brings misfortune.

What is meant by "Favor and disgrace bring fear"?
  Favor stands high; disgrace low.
  Fear of gaining; fear of losing.
This is meant by "Favor and disgrace bring fear".

What is meant by "Having self brings misfortune"?
  My great misfortune  is because I am a self.
  When I have no self  then I have no trouble. 

Therefore,
  One who treasures self over the world can be given the entire world.
  One who cares for self over the world can be trusted with the world.

------------------- Ch 14 ------------------
