# Tao Te Ching
# Or "The Path of Virtue"

Tao = the journey, the path, the road
Te = integrity, virtue, driving force
Ching = book of 

========= The Book of the Path ============
------------------- Ch 01 -----------------

A tao-able tao is not the constant TAO.
A name-able name, not the constant NAME.

Without name is the origin of heaven and earth.
Bearing name is the mother of all myriad things.

Therefore,
  Constantly without desire gaze upon its source.
  Constantly bearing desire gaze upon its effects.

Both these persons, of one essence yet differing in name,
Mystery of being one,
Mystery of mysteries, door to the source of great wonder.

------------------- Ch 02 ------------------

If everyone knows beauty as beautiful  already so ugly.
If everyone knows goodness to be good  already so evil.

Therefore:
  Presence and absence produce one another,
  Difficult and easy complement one another,
  Long and short are shaped with one another,
  High and low fall in love with one another,
  Voice and echo harmonize with one another,
  Before and after each follow one another.

So a holy person:
  Acts by taking no actions,
  Teaches by using no words.

All myriad things are dutiful, each:
  Produces but does not possess,
  Acts but does not seek thanks.

They become successful,
and do not dwell on it.

They do not grow proud, and
success does not leave them.

------------------- Ch 03 ------------------ 

Stop proclaiming the great among you, and thus end fighting.
Stop treasuring stuff for its rarity, and thus end thievery.
Stop evoking desire, and thus bring serenity to every heart.

So the governance of a holy person:
  keeps hearts clear
  keeps bellies full
  keeps blood cooled
  keeps bones strong
  makes the people without scheming & without desire
  makes it so those with schemes dare not enact them

Act without acting,
and nothing will be ungoverned.

------------------- Ch 04 ------------------ 

The TAO is empty and usage will not fill it.
Its deepness prefigures all physical things:

  Keeps edges dull,
  Keeps ropes free,
  Keeps light warm,
  Keeps earth rich.

The PEARL sits, difficult to discern.
I do not know whose child it could be,
since it predates every visible god.

------------------- Ch 05 ------------------ 

Heaven & Earth are impartial all physical things are chaff.
The holy person is impartial the base multitudes are chaff.

The space between Heaven and Earth is like pair of bellows:
  Emptied, but never finished.
  Moved, but sending out more.

Countless words,
miss the center.

------------------- Ch 06 ------------------ 

Harvest spirits are immortal,
This is the feminine mystery.

The gate of feminine mystery,
The root of heaven and earth.

Flowing difficult to discern,
Persisting without oversight.

------------------- Ch 07 ------------------ 

The vast Heavens and eternal Earth,
Heaven and Earth will age and grow.

  by keeping selfless
  they endure forever

So a holy person,
  puts themself last and is first
  denies themself and still lives

So by keeping the self from evil,
the self is kept able to triumph.

------------------- Ch 08 ------------------ 

The highest goodness is like water;
Water nourishes all things without contention
It rests in places regarded as low;
Therefore it becomes as Tao:

    dwelling where proper
    kindness in its heart
    offering benevolently
    reliable in its words
    governing with wisdom
    acting in its ability
    having perfect timing

It lives without contention,
and becomes beyond reproach.

------------------- Ch 09 ------------------

Pours and stops  to not overflow.
Over sharpening  dulls the blade.
A treasure room  no one is there.
Money and pride  invite calamity.

  Task accomplished,
  withdraw yourself.

This is the WAY of heaven.

------------------- Ch 10 ------------------ 

Balancing a soul, holding TRUTH,
can you keep them both together?

Concentrating on soft breathing,
can you become as a little baby?

Polishing your surveying mirror,
can you make it without blemish?

Governing and loving all people,
can you resist from interfering?

Everday people are born and die,
can you keep the female mystery?

Gaining insight in all subjects,
can you avoid closing your mind?

Gives and sustains life,
  Produces but does not possess,
  Acts but does not seek thanks,
  Governs but does not dominate.

Its name: Mystic Virtue.

------------------- Ch 11 ------------------ 

Thirty spokes joining at one hub; the
 space between makes the wheel usable.

Knead clay to make the container; the
 emptiness makes the container usable.

Chisel a window to make the room; the
 interior space makes the room usable.

Thus, presence creates benefit,
and absence creates usefulness.

------------------- Ch 12 ------------------ 

Five colors blind the eyes,
Five tones deafen the ears,
Five foods spoil the mouth,
Riding and hunting make the heart wild with excitement.
Difficult-to-find treasures make people turn on others.

So a holy person:
  fills their belly,
  and not their eye.

Therefore one is chosen,
and the other discarded. 

------------------- Ch 13 ------------------ 

Favor and disgrace bring fear,
Having self brings misfortune.

What is meant by "Favor and disgrace bring fear"?
  Favor stands high; disgrace low.
  Fear of gaining; fear of losing.
This is meant by "Favor and disgrace bring fear".

What is meant by "Having self brings misfortune"?
  My great misfortune  is because I am a self.
  When I have no self  then I have no trouble. 

Therefore,
  One who treasures self over worldly dominion can be given the entire world.
  One who cares for self over worldly dominion can be trusted with the world.

------------------- Ch 14 ------------------ 

Looked for but not perceived, we call empty.
Listened for but not heard, we call hopeful.
Reached for but not possessed, we call tiny. 

    These three cannot be interfaced,
    Therefore mixing they act as one.

Their upper half neither clear nor bright,
Their lower half neither clouded nor hazy.
Continuing on-and-on without a name,
And returning back into nothingness.

This is called the shape of having no shape.

    Image that lacks an image,
    This is called indistinct.

Approaching them you cannot see their face,
Following behind you cannot see their back.

    Wield the ancient Tao,
    to manage the present.

Knowing the ancient origin,
this is called Tao's reign.

------------------- Ch 15 ------------------ 

The ancient scholars of goodness,
Subtle and versed in all mystery,
They are beyond our discernments.

And being beyond discernment,
We must sketch an appearance:

  Hesitant as one crossing an icy river, as if in fear of neighbors.
  Solemn and formal as guests, vanishing as the ice that shall melt.

  Honest as simple wood,
  Vast as a wide valley,
  Opaque as muddy water.

Who by settling mud can  slowly make clear water?
Who by staying calm can  slowly bring it to life?

One who keeps the TAO does not desire to overflow.
And by not overflowing, 
Is able to persist while being made anew.

------------------- Ch 16 ------------------ 

    At ultimate emptiness,
    hold fast tranquility.

    All myriad things arise together,
    I keep watch for their returning.

Myriad creatures each returns to its root.
Returning to the root we call tranquility,
Tranquility is called restoration of life,
Restoration of life we call eternal flame,
Knowing the eternal flame we call clarity.

To know eternity is to accept what comes,
To accept whatever comes is impartiality,
As staying impartial makes good kingship,
           and good kingship is heavenly:

Heaven is thus TAO - TAO is thus eternal;
       and the self stays without danger.

------------------- Ch 17 ------------------ 

The greatest king  no one knows they have,
The next greatest  both loved and praised,
The next greatest  is feared,
The next greatest  is mocked.

When rulers are not trusting,
The people do not trust them.

Patient and deliberate, valuing each word,
With success obtained and matters settled,
The people will say "We did it ourselves".

------------------- Ch 18 ------------------ 

Tao is abandoned    truth and justice.
Intelligence grows    fakes and fraud.
Family argues    piety and compassion.
Chaotic country    faithful officials. 

------------------- Ch 19 ------------------ 

End wisdom, discard insight,
The people benefit 100 fold.

End justice, discard giving.
Compassion and piety return.

End cunning, discard profit,
So thievery will be no more.

These three, outward facing, are insufficient,
Thus this teaching finds the place it belongs:

    Observe the plain  embrace the simple.
    Reduce selfishness  make scant desire.

------------------- Ch 20 ------------------ 

End study and worry stops.
Of flattery and sincerity, how far between them?
Of fair and ugly, what distance is between them?
Of that which peoples fear, can you be unafraid?
These get endless neglect.

    The people hustle and bustle,
    As enjoying great sacrifices,
    As springing up to the stage.

I alone am anchored, without anticipation,
As one not yet a child, instead an infant.
So weary, as without a place to return to.

    The people have in abundance,
    While I alone am left behind.

I am foolish of heart - so foolish!
Confused! The layity think clearly.

    I alone am drowsy.
    The layity, alert.

I alone stay shut,
Over the vast and tranquil ocean,
the wind blows without any trace.

    The people each have their trades,
    and I alone am stubborn and lowly,

I alone am different from others,
I value the Mother who nourishes.

------------------- Ch 21 ------------------ 

One that appears of virtue,
Will be following only TAO,
As a physical thing TAO is:

Only hazy, only indistinct,
So indistinct, and so hazy,

And among it is manifested,
So hazy, and so indistinct,

And among it dimly present,
So deep, so quiet, so dark,

And among it is an essence,
An essence greatly genuine,

And among it sits fidelity,
From ancient times til now,
Its name has never left it.

We may observe its parents,
By what do I know the parents of this multitude?
By these:

------------------- Ch 22 ------------------ 

Yielding and so remaining whole.
Bending and still standing tall.
Emptying out and staying filled.
Wearing out and being made anew.

    A little bit brings benefit,
    but a whole lot just perplexes.

So a holy person embraces ONE,
setting a model for the world:

    Not flaunting, but being seen clearly.
    Not presuming, but keeping dilligence.
    Not attacking, but holding fast honor.
    Not boasting, and so enduring forever.

They live without contention,
So nothing in the world will be in contention with them.
When the ancients said "Yielding and so remaining whole"
These words, were they empty?
Return back and remain whole.

------------------- Ch 23 ----------------- 

Tersity is natural,
Because storms cannot last all morning;
Downpours cannot last all day.
Who makes this so? Heaven and Earth do.
Heaven and Earth cannot make them last,
And therefore how can humans?

So Taoists follow the TAO,

    Following the TAO is the TAO,
    Following virtue is virtuous,
    Following sin misses the mark.

Likewise taoists, the TAO  pleased to have them.
The virtuous, all virtues  pleased to have them.
The sinners, all the sins  pleased to have them.

A person without sufficient trust,
Others will have no trust in them.

------------------- Ch 24 ----------------- 

One cannot stand forever waiting on tiptoes,
One cannot stretch far while standing still,

One who makes themself seen cannot be clear,
One who always presumes cannot be dilligent.

One who praises themself can earn no merit,
One who boasts of themself will not endure.

Those with the Tao say these are redundant or leftover,
Such things are evil,
So those with Tao do not dwell on them.

------------------- Ch 25 ----------------- 

Created and bearing a name,
Prefiguring heaven & earth,

    So silent! So empty!
    Alone and unchanging.

Walking the circle; free from peril,
I believe she is the world's Mother.

Not knowing its name,
I use the word "Tao",
I try describing it as great,
    Great means flowing past,
    Flowing past makes a WAY,
    The way of reconiliation.

Therefore, TAO is great.
        Heaven is great.
         Earth is great.
      Kingship is great.

The land has four great things,
Kingship counts as one of them.

The people emulate earth,
As earth emulates heaven.

Heaven emulates TAO,
TAO emulates nature.

------------------- Ch 26 ----------------- 

Heaviness is the root of lightness,
Calmness is master of restlessness,

Therefore the holy person travels all day,
    Not leaving the heavy wagon,
    Gazing upon glorious sights,
    Enjoying them at a distance.

Now should the master of many chariots,
Make themself lighter before the world?

    Lightness is the root of sin,
    Restlessness loses the crown.

------------------- Ch 27 ----------------- 

A good walker leaves no path,
A good speaker does not slip,
A good assessor has no tally,

A good locksmith uses no latch but what they shut cannot be opened,
A good knot tyer uses no ropes but what they bind cannot be loosed.

So a holy person:
    Always saves others, and so
    does not abandon any person.
    Always saves things, and so
    leaves nothing as abandoned.

This is "following with clarity".

Thus the good man is a model for the weak man,
And the weak man should support their teacher.

    Do not value the model,
    Nor love their student.

    This perplexing wisdom,
    Is an essential wonder.

------------------- Ch 28 ----------------- 

Know masculinity, keep femininity,
    And so be the world's rivulet.
    And being the world's rivulet,
    Eternal virtue does not leave,
Returning become as a little baby.

Know of the yang, keep to the yin, 
    And so be the world's paragon,
    And being the world's paragon,
    Eternal virtue will not decay,
Returning become without boundary.

Know the honor, keep the disgrace,
    And become the world's valley.
    Then being the world's valley,
    Eternal virtue will be enough,
    Returning become a wood block.

Split simple wood for instruments,
    The holy person will use them,
    To make the government endure,
Thus great cutting does not sever.

------------------- Ch 29 ----------------- 

Who shall seize the world and improve it?
I see that this cannot be done.

The world is a divine instrument,
And thus it cannot be controlled,
Those who control it face defeat,
Those who grasp for it will fail.

Because each physical thing:
    Sometimes leads  sometimes follows,
    Sometimes blows  sometimes inhales,
    Sometimes grows  sometimes withers,
    Sometimes rules  sometimes revolts.

So a holy person:
    Avoids grasping control,
    Avoids owning in excess,
    Avoids having arrogance.

------------------- Ch 30 ----------------- 

So the Taoist minister tells the ruler,
Do not thicken the world with soldiers,
Such affairs tend to backfire.

    Where the troops are encamped,
    Thistles and thorns take root,
    And following each great army,
    Are certainly years of famine.

The good achieve their goal then stop.
They do not dare continue using force.

    Achieve then do not boast,
    Achieve then do not gloat,
    Achieve without arrogance,
    Achieve only when there is no other way,
    Achieve then end violence.

Things grow strong, then age,
This is called the "not TAO",
The "not TAO" passes quickly.

------------------- Ch 31 ----------------- 

A big military is a tool of misfortune,
Everything detests it,
Thus those with TAO do not dwell on it.

At home, a prince favors his left hand,
During war he favors his right instead.

Soldiers are instruments of misfortune,
And not the instruments of some prince.

If being compelled to make use of them,
Do not relish in it; win without glory.

    Those who glorify,
    Are happy to kill.

One who happily kills,
Will not obtain their wordly ambitions.

When rejoicing favor the left,
When mourning favor the right.

Officers standing on the left,
A general stands at the right,
They stand as if at a funeral.

So much killing,
And so they mourn with sorrow.

Victories in war are funerals.

------------------- Ch 32 ----------------- 

Eternal TAO is nameless.
So simple and small yet
nothing in the world could subjugate it.

Kings and princes, if they would follow,
All physical things would become guests:

    Heaven and Earth in harmony,
    Soft dew descends willingly,

    Commanded by no person, 
    it itself is equitable. 

    From the start there were names,
    Names were already in existance.

Tao's existence in the world is like:
Streams to valleys; rivers to oceans.
    
------------------- Ch 33 ----------------- 

To understand others is wisdom,
To know oneself is discernment.

To overcome others requires force,
Overcoming oneself shows strength.

Knowing contentment makes one wealthy,
Proceeding with vigor shows willpower.

One who does not lose their place endures,
One who dies without perishing is forever.

------------------- Ch 34 ----------------- 

    The TAO is like a great flood,
    It pushes both left and right.

It provides life; relied on by myriad things it remains with them.
It accomplishes its tasks while bearing no name.
It clothes and feeds myriad things without acting as their master.

    Constantly without desire,
    It could be named "small".

All myriad things return to it, but it never acts as their master.

    It could be named "great".

Even until the end, it claims no greatness.
Therefore, it honestly can be called great.

------------------- Ch 35 ----------------- 

    Hold to the great image,
    And the world will come.

Coming without harm, most harmonious,
Then music and food, travellers stop.

    The Tao arising from the mouth,
    Bland almost as without flavor.

Looking is not enough to perceive it.
Hearing is not enough to decipher it.
Being used is not enough to empty it.

------------------- Ch 36 ----------------- 

Who shall breath out? Certainly one who breathed in.
Who shall become weak? Certainly one who was strong.
Who shall get toppled? Certainly one who built tall.
Who shall earn things? Certainly one who gave first.

So, this subtle clarity,
    soft-and-weak defeats hard-and-strong.

Fish cannot escape the ocean,
And the weapons of a country,
Should not be commonly shown.

------------------- Ch 37 ---------------- 

Tao is constantly without action,
Also constantly without inaction.

If princes and kings can keep it,
All myriad things will transform.

Transformed yet desiring success.
I shall supress them with nameless simplicity.

    The nameless simplicity,
    Shall be without desire.

    Without desire, quietly,
    the world comes to rest.

========= The Book of Virtue ============
------------------- Ch 38 ---------------

High virtue seeks no virtue,
And by doing so is virtuous.

Low virtue sticks to virtue,
And so is lacking in virtue.

High virtue takes no action,
And finishes all their work.

Low virtue performs actions,
Yet leaves some work undone.

High compassion uses action,
And finishes all their work.

High justice enacts actions,
Yet leaves some work undone.

High tradition takes action,
Still there lacks agreement,
Then rolls up their sleeves and pushes around,

Thus the Tao is lost as is virtue,
Lose virtue there goes compassion,
Lose compassion then goes justice,
Lose justice there goes tradition.

    Dedication to tradition:
    A thin shell of sincerity,
    Filled with messy thought.

    Ones with foreknowledge:
    Flowers embellish the Tao,
    The origin of great folly.

Thus those of mighty mind,
Care for the inside, not dwelling on the shell.
Care for the fruit, not dwelling on the flower.

Therefore one is chosen,
and the other discarded.

------------------- Ch 39 ---------------- 

Those who formerly attained oneness:

    Heaven - became whole and clean.
    Earth - became whole and steady.
    Gods - became whole and powerful.
    Valleys - became whole and ample.
    All myriad things - then whole and alive.
    Princes and kings - admired by the world.

After becoming whole it follows:

    Heaven - without cleanliness it would fall,
    Earth - without stability it would shatter,
    Gods - without power they would be exhausted,
    Valleys - without ampleness they would decay,
    All myriad things - without life they would go extinct, 
    The princes - without admiration they fear any stumble.

Thus the superior is rooted from the inferior,
The high require a foundation from the lowest.

Thus princes view themselves as: orphans, windows, hungry.
The superior is claiming for a foundation! Is this not so?

Therefore ultimate status is no status,
Wish not to be one of many like stones,
Nor a precious gem.

------------------- Ch 40 ---------------- 

The movements of TAO will reconcile,
The proper usage of TAO is to yield.

The myriad things are born from something,
Something is born from nothing.

------------------- Ch 41 ---------------- 

The foremost student hears TAO,
With both diligence and action.

The middling student hears TAO,
Retaining some, missing others.

The very low student hears TAO,
And guffaws.

   Without prompting laughter, 
   it is not sufficiently TAO.

And so as the proverbs have it:

   Bright paths appear as dark,
   Progress seems like regress,
   The smooth ways seem uneven.

   Solid virtue seems a valley,
   Great self seems a disgrace.

   Bountiful virtue seems thin.
   Creating virtue seems theft,
   True quality seems shifting.

Great squares are without edge,
Great tools take time to build,
Great sounds will carry softly,
Great images are lacking forms.

    TAO's secret, without name,
    Only the TAO,
       Both leniant and strict.

------------------- Ch 42 ---------------- 

TAO then one,
One then two,
Two then three,
Three then all myriad things.

All myriad things carry yin and embrace yang,
Breathing out by the action of both.

People regard as low
words like: orphaned, widowed, and hungry.
Yet impartial kings call themselves these.

Thus things,
    Sometimes gain by diminishing,
    Sometimes diminish by gaining.

What others teach,
I will also teach.

The violent do not obtain natural deaths,
This shall be the father of my teachings.

------------------- Ch 43 ---------------- 

The very soft of the world
overcomes the very hard of the world.

Being without substance it
enters places that are without space.

By this I know the benefit of taking no actions.

    Teach without any words,
    Benefit without actions.

These are beyond most of the world.

------------------- Ch 44 ---------------- 

Which is loved, your fame or your self?
Which is more, your self or your coins?
Which is most ruinous, to gain or lose?

Thus, excess fame certainly means great expense,
Continued hoarding certainly means heavy losses.

    Know contentment  to avoid disgrace.
    Know when to stop  to avoid dangers.

Follow these and by them endure forever.

------------------- Ch 45 ---------------- 

Great perfection  seems deficient.
Yet when used  it never will fail.

Great fullness  seems to be empty.
Yet when used  is never exhausted.

The greatly upright seem to waver,
The greatly skilled seem ungainly,
Great arguments seem inarticulate.

    Impatience defeats being cold,
    Quietness defeats overheating.

Calm quiet actions are proper for the world.

------------------- Ch 46 ---------------- 

The world has TAO: swift horses valued for manure.
The world lacks TAO: warhorses born on the border.

    No crime     greater than acting on desire,
    No calamity  greater than being discontent,
    No fault     greater than nuturing avarice.

Therefore, be content with contentment,
Contentment is eternal.

------------------- Ch 47 ---------------- 

Without leaving the house  know the whole world.
Without peering from windows  see heaven's PATH.

    When roaming around,
    Knowledge decreases.

So a holy person,
    Does not walk yet knows,
    Does not find yet names,
    Succeeds without acting.

------------------- Ch 48 ---------------- 

Study more and increase each day,
Follow TAO and decrease each day.

Decrease and decrease,
Until taking no actions,
No actions nothing undone,
Without plan take the world.

Those who make plans,
Cannot seize the world.

------------------- Ch 49 ---------------- 

A holy person lacks a constant heart,
They take on the heart of the people.

    Generous people I will give to.
    Stingy people I also will give to.
    Virtue is generous.

    Honest people I am honest with.
    Dishonest people I am honest with.
    Virtue has honesty.

Holy people with TAO breath in the world,
Moving in the world muddies their hearts.

The people intent on using eyes and ears,
They all are children of the holy person.

------------------- Ch 50 ---------------- 

At birth, death begins.

    Followers of birth, 3-in-10,
    Followers of death, 3-in-10,

People who value birth, and so move to death's realm,
Also 3-in-10.

Why is this?
Because they care heavily for being alive.

I hear that one who safeguards their life,
Travelling does not meet rhinos or tigers,
Meets no misfortune from armored soldiers.

The rhino has no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger has no place to slash its claws,
The soldier has no place to use his blade.

Why is this?
They make no place for the realm of death.

------------------- Ch 51 ---------------- 

    The TAO gives birth,
    Virtue will sustain,
    Myriad things shape,
    Inertia will finish.

Thus the myriad things,
They all venerate TAO and value virtue.

    TAO is venerated, 
    Virtue is valued.

    Not because of decree,
    But by eternal nature.

So, the TAO gives birth,
And virtue will sustain.

    Both nurses and educates them,
    Sees that they finish growing,
    Rears them, provides for them,
    
    Produces but does not possess,
    Acts but does not seek thanks,
    Governs but does not dominate,

Its name: Mystic Virtue.

------------------- Ch 52 ---------------- 

The world has an origin,
which is the world's mother,

    By knowing the mother,
    We can know the child.

Once you know the child,
Return and guard the mother,
Without body you cannot die.

    Shut your senses, 
    Close your doors;
    Your life is without toil.

    Open your senses,
    Assist in things;
    You are without salvation.

Observe the small with clarity.
Protect the soft with strength.

With their light,
Return to provide them clarity.

Do not bring yourself disaster,
Constant actions become habits.

------------------- Ch 53 ---------------- 

Had I been introduced to a little knowledge,
I would walk along the great WAY,
And fear only to deviate from it.

The great WAY is smooth and even,
Yet the people prefer side paths.

    A corrupt ruling dynasty,
    The farms full of thorns,
    The granary picked clean,
    Clothes of bright colors,
    Sharp swords at the belt,
    Full from food and drink.

They have wealth in abundance,
This is the vanity of thieves,
And is in contrast to the TAO!

------------------- Ch 54 ---------------- 

A solid foundation is not easy to uproot,
What is tightly embraced will not escape;
It will be venerated by every generation.

Cultivate it in yourself, then virtue is genuine.
Cultivate in your family, then virtue is abundant.
Cultivate in your groups, then virtue is reaching.
Cultivate in your country, and virtue spills over.
Cultivate in your world, and virtue is everywhere.

Therefore,
    As a person, observe other people,
    As a family, observe other families,
    As a group, observe other communities,
    As a country, observe other governments,
    With the world, observe the whole world.

By what do I observe the world's nature?
By these:

------------------- Ch 55 ---------------- 

Those holding profound virtue,
Are similar to young children:

  Poisonous bugs do not sting them,
  Fearsome beasts do not claw them,
  Large eagles will not grasp them,

Slender bones and soft muscle,
Yet their grip is firm.

Not aware of intercourse, but aroused,
This is having vitality.

Shouts all day without growing hoarse,
This is knowing harmony.

    Knowing harmony - this is constancy,
    Knowing constancy - this is clarity,

Striving for the vitality of youth is inauspicious,
For the heart to control the breath requires force.

    Things grow strong, then age,
    They are named the "not TAO",
    The "not TAO" passes quickly.

------------------- Ch 56 ---------------- 

Those who know do not speak,
Those who speak do not know.

    Keeps words held,
    Keeps gates shut,
    Keeps edges dull,
    Keeps ropes free,
    Keeps light warm,
    Keeps earth rich.

Its name - Mystic Unity.

Therefore,
    It cannot be kept as close family,
    Nor can it be held at a distance.

    It cannot be exploited for profit,
    Nor will is lead to complications.

    It cannot be valued as expensive,
    Nor can it be valued as worthless.

Thus, unity in the world is priceless.

------------------- Ch 57  ---------------- 

Conduct properly civil affairs,
With soliders aim for surprise.

Without a plan seize the world.
By what do I know its nature?
By these:

    A world with many taboos,
    All the people then poor.

    People with many weapons,
    Country falls into chaos.

    Men of talent and timing,
    Odd events bring revolts.

    Laws gain sophistication,
    Then there is much theft.

So the holy person spoke:

    I act without action; the citizens change themselves.
    I am properly quiet; the citizens correct themselves.
    I am without schemes; the citizens enrich themselves.
    I am without desire; the citizens embrace simplicity.

------------------- Ch 58  ---------------- 

Government is relaxed and calm,
The people are honest and true.

Government checks and inspects,
The people are shrewd and wily.

Calamity! The foundation of fortune.
Fortune! Gets overswept by calamity.

    Who can know of the endings,
    Lacking the correct origins?

    Correctness becomes strange,
    Good actions turn into ills,

    People are bewildered,
    They surely will be forever.

So a holy person,
    Right angled without corners,
    Stays honest without harming,
    Is upright without hostility,
    Sheds light without blinding.

------------------- Ch 59  ---------------- 

In governing people and serving heaven,
Nothing better than frugality,

A person who holds nothing begins weaving a garment,
Weaving a garment from layers of accumulated virtue,
Layers of virtue are strong; they can do everything.

That person can do everything,
So strong! No one knows of their limit.

No one knows of their limit, they become sovereign.
With the country's mother, they become everlasting.

This is called deep root and firm foundation,
The far stretching and eternally awaited TAO.

------------------- Ch 60  ---------------- 

Govern a great nation; cook a small fish,

    With TAO administer the world,
    Its demons then without power,

Not only its demons without power,
But its powers shall not harm you,

Not only will powers not harm you,
But holy people will not harm you,

Those two do not harm one another,
Thus virtue again returns to them.

------------------- Ch 61  ---------------- 

A great state kneels becoming like a vast river,
The collection of many waters,
The feminine within the world,

The feminine in stillness subdues the masculine,
Subdues with active stillness,

So a great state, by kneeling to a lesser state,
Then subdues the lesser state,

The lesser state, by kneeling to greater states,
Can subdue the greater states.

Thus the one, by kneeling, annexes,
The other, by kneeling, is annexed.

The greater state wishes only to shepherd the peoples,
The smaller state wishes only to provide its services.

Both of these  able to obtain what they wish,
For the great  the proper action is to kneel.
