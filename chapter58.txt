其政悶悶      its politics shut-shut
其民淳淳      its citizens pure-pure
其政察察      its politics scrutinizing-scrutizing
其民缺缺      its citizens lacking-lacking

Government is relaxed and calm,
The people are honest and true.

Government checks and inspects,
The people are shrewd and wily.


禍兮福之所倚   disaster so fortune of place reliance
福兮禍之所伏   fortune so distaster of place forfeited

Calamity! The foundation of fortune.
Fortune! Gets overswept by calamity.


孰知其極      who knows its extremes
其無正耶      its without correct origin

Who can know of the endings,
Lacking the correct origins?

Correctness becomes strange,
Good actions turn into ills,

The people are bewildered,
They will surely be forever.



正復為奇      correct complex action odd
善復為妖      good complex action gremlin

人之迷       man of bewilderment
其日固久      its day firm longtime

    loves justice with compassion
    stands upright but not ruthless

So a holy person,
    Right angled without corners,
    Stays honest without harming,
    Is upright without hostility,
    Sheds light without blinding.

是以聖人      So the holy person
方而不割      square but not cutapart
廉而不劌      incorruptible but not cutharmed
直而不肆      upright but not unrestrained
光而不耀      light but not glorious
